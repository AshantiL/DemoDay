<h1>What I think about Englewood Codes?</h1>

  <p>Englewood Codes provides a great opportunity for teens to become interactive in a positive way.</p>
  
  <p>This program allows us to learn more details about technology and how we can become more open minded to it</p>

  <p>This program allows peers to know each other since they live in different parts of Chicago to unite as one</p>
  
<h1>How does Englewood Codes impact the community</h1>
  
    <p>The instructors not only give us information about current events in technology but around the world also.</p>
    
    <p>We have sessions to expresss our opinions about the session and current events around us</p>
   
    <p>With these sessions it allows us to see our reflection because the instructors wants us to open up more about ourselves so that way we wont feel ashamed.</p>
    
    <p>Englewood Codes is more than just a program. It is like a safe haven</p>
